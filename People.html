      <h3>
        <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>
      </h3>
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently in CN division. Before comming to CERN, Tim worked on, among other things, document production and text processing. He developped his first hypertext system, "Enquire", in 1980 for his own use (although unaware of the existence of the term HyperText). With a background in text processing, real-time software and communications, Tim decided that high energy physics needed a networked hypertext system and CERN was an ideal site for the development of wide-area hypertext ideas. Tim started the WorldWideWeb project at CERN in 1989. He wrote the application on the NeXT along with most of the communications software. Phone: 3755, Email: timbl@info.cern.ch

      <h3>
        <b>Robert Cailiau</b>
      </h3>
    </p>

    <p>
      Formerly in programming language design and compiler construction, Robert has been interested in document production since 1975, when he designed and implemented a widely used document markup and formatting system. He ran CERN's Office Computing Systems group from 87 to 89. He is a long-time user of Hypercard, which he used to such diverse ends as writing trip reports, games, bookkeeping software, and budget preparation forms. When he is not doing WWW's public relations, Robert is contributing browser software for the Macintosh platform, and analysing the needs of physics experiments for online data access.

        <b>Peter Dobberstein</b>
      </h3>
    </p>

    <p>
      While at the DESY lab in Hamburg (DE), Peter did the port of the line-mode browser onto MVS and, indirectly, VM/CMS. These were the most difficult of the ports to date. He also overcame many incidental problems in making a large amount of information in the DESY database available.

      <h3>
        <b>Jean-Francois Groff</b>
      </h3>
    </p>

    <p>
      Provided some useful input in the "design issues". During his stay at CERN as "cooperant", J-F joined the project in September 1991. He wrote the gateway to the VMS Help system , worked on the new modular browser architecure, and helped support and present WWW at all levels. He is now porting the communications code to DECnet in order to set up servers for physics experiments. JF now works for NeXT Europe but continues his interest in the web...( Contact )
